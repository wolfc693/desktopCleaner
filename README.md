Only run main.py file. It will call the other files.
This program will specifically look for the following file extensions: .doc, .docx, .jpg, or .eml. It will also only move files that fit a naming convention with the first 4 characters as letters and the next 3 characters as numbers.
You will need to add in the path to your desktop, and the destination where you want the new folders made.
